Good job with the app - I know the project I gave you all was a difficult one and I am glad you had a chance to try it. Your app design is very clean (I like the small logo), but there are two major comments I have. The first is on the design. There are 4 text boxes, and it is unclear what I am supposed to type into each textbox to actually set the alarm. No matter what combination I try, I always get the same error: MakeInstant takes arguments of a particular form. The way you have it set up, the most intuitive way to type into the 4 boxes would be to type one digit into each box. However, this is probably not the way I would recommend. When I think about how I normally input times into textboxes, I think of two text boxes, one for the hour and one for the minute. When you are thinking about user interfaces (which we will talk about in a few weeks), it helps to think about interfaces that are not too different from what users are already used to. 

There is also a bug in your code where the format of the MakeInstant you make from the userâ€™s text input is incorrect. If you send me a screenshot of your blocks editor, I can suggest corrections to make it work properly. In all, good job taking the challenge of learning something new by yourself and making something interesting. If you want to keep working to get the project exactly where you want it, I am happy to help you.
